Why is cartpole-v1 considered an easy benchmark?

Cartpole is considered an easy benchmark because:
- It has a very little action space: the cart can only move left or right
- It has a small state space: only those four earlier properties can be measured.
- Simple Dynamics: Because it is a 2D environment, it creates some abstraction and makes it easier for the agent to understand the dynamics.
