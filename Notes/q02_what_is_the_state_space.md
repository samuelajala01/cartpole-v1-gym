What is the State Space, and why are they chosen?
<br>
Think of the state space as a set of all information or properties that we can use to describe the state of the cartpole.

These properties in the case of this cartpole are:
- The Cart Position(x): This describes where the cart is on the track.
- The Cart's Velocity: how fast or slow the cart is moving
- The Pole's angle
- The Pole's angular velocity: this describes how fast or slow the pole is tilting
<br>
Why these variables?
<br>
Well...they follow the rules of physics. If you know the position of an object, how fast the object is moving, physics allows you predict where the object will likely end up.
